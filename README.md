	1. Clone/Download the repository to your local drive.
	2. From the command line at project root, run `npm install` and `npm start`
	3. If the browser does not automatically open the app, then with your server running,
	 navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

This project wouldn't have been possible without the fantastic help of Doug Brown. His [walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVAVLCJwAAo&feature=youtu.be) as well as his guidance in Slack forum was priceless. Thank you so much!

I would also like to thank Robert L for helping me to understand how to create my markers. Even though I wasn't able to use the google-maps-react Marker component, he helped me understand how to use the GoogleAPI function to create my markers, and how to connect them to the google-maps-react wrapper.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Emulated backend server was provided by [cors-anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere/). The use of this is solely for the testing and review of this project. It is not intended for public use.

Photos are provided via the [YelpFusion API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3).
